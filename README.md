Project Description :

Water is considered as a vital resource that affects various aspects of human health and lives. The quality of water is a major concern for people living in urban areas. The quality of water serves as a powerful environmental determinant and a foundation for the prevention and control of waterborne diseases. However predicting the urban water quality is a challenging task since the water quality varies in urban spaces non-linearly and depends on multiple factors, such as meteorology, water usage patterns, and land uses, so this project aims at building a Machine Learning (ML) model to Predict Water Quality by considering all water quality standard indicators.

Project Objectives:

To detect the quality of water. Make the application available for everyone. Building interactive UI to ensure user satisfaction. 

Services Used:

Anaconda Navigator
Jupyter Notebook
All necessary Python packages 

Technical Architecture:
